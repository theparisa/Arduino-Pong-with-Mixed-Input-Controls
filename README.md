# Arduino-Pong-with-Mixed-Input-Controls

This project is a complete implementation of the classic arcade game Pong, built on an Arduino and displayed on a monochrome OLED screen. The left paddle is controlled using a traditional analog potentiometer, providing simple and direct manual input. The right paddle offers a modern, hands-free experience by using an ultrasonic distance sensor to measure the position of the player's hand.

## **Features**
* Graphics displayed on a 128x64 OLED screen.
* Includes start screens and game-over menus.
* Automatic score tracking up to a winning limit.
* Features full ball and paddle collision detection.
* Includes a complete game reset and "play again" function.

## **Innovative Aspects**
*  Blends a classic analog input (potentiometer) with a modern sensor-based input (ultrasonic) for two unique player experiences.
*  The ultrasonic sensor creates an intuitive, hands-free control system where a player moves their hand to position the paddle.
*  Implements a full, standalone game experience from the title screen to gameplay, win conditions, and a restart menu.
